The script will compile the data found through its analysis of the bets pulled
from the api. Once all the bets have been analyzed, a document will be constructed
with the necessary information according to the following schema.

SCHEMA:

 - Title: UTC Time of Update
 - Bet list:
   - Bet object:
     - Core Values: (display necessary)
       - Expected Value (%)
       - Event Date (Human Time)
       - Event:
         - Contenders
         - Sport
         - League
       - Bets (Two for Two-way markets)
       - Books
       - No Vig Odds
       - Market Width
       - Last Updated (Human Time)
   - Logging:
     - Time processed
     - Total PEV Bets found
     - All Vig associated with Bets
     - Document Size


In general, this schema will allow the client to easily parse and find the new
bets that the algorithm has found. Additionally, the logging can allow for better
system maintenance and success tracking. Finally, it will be interesting to find
a way to keep track of the number of bets that change per update to get a better
understanding of how often the odds change in the sports betting market.
