This is a to-do quide for the postive expected values development:
 TODO:
 - Each type of bet was split so that they can be processed on their own, finish off this processing line
   for each of the given betting line types. This is totals, spreads, and money line.
 - For the actual file, all that needs to be done is the line comparison, the value check, and then the storage into
   the actual database that the client can pull from.
