The following is a quick guide to git branches in this repository. There are three main types of branches. The first is
the master branch. This is the branch that contains all review passing code that has been tested and reviewed. This is
the branch that will eventually be lifted to production.

The next main branch is the develop branch. This branch contains all pending changes and is where feature branches are
pulled into to make sure that they are compatible. The develop branch is not where large features are built but it is
where changes are organized and tested to work out any issues before pushing to master.

Finally, there are feature branches. There are denoted "feature/branch-name". Each feature branch represents a new
feature or functionality that is being added to the app. This allows for more protection for the develop branch and
means that features can be developed individually and tested in a contained environment before a larger testing is
done.

For all new functionality that requires new files, create a feature branch. Small changes can be done on the develop
branch is they do not require new files or directories. The goal here is to avoid any need for a rebase and other git
conflicts that may arise. Finally, the feature branch "feature/mac-work" represents a branch for work done on another computer, not
specifically a functionality.
