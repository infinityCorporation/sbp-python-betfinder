It has been discovered that the current method of positive EV will no longer work to find bets with a positive
expected value. The new approach has only been designed theoretically at the given time. The current idea is to take a
given two-way event, say something like an NBA game, and calculate essentially the probability of each side happening
based on the vig-removed implied probability. From here, we can create our own market determined line, say -250 or +130,
for each side of the event. Then, we can go through and compare each line for each side of the event at each book to
this determined line. So if we had 5 books on 1 event with a total of 10 lines, 5 of the lines would get compared to the
favorite and 5 to the underdog with the positive ev equation.

Some things worth noting about this method are as follows. Firstly, I need to make sure that I removed the vig from each
book's lines before anything else happens. Essentially, we need a new set of lines for each book that are vig adjusted.
Additionally, I need to make sure that I am accurately comparing the lines to their counterpart market average line.
This is important for certain bets where you may not have a specific 'underdog' or 'favorite'. Finally, I think it is
also important to check some of the math on this due to the fact that this method has not yet been fully confirmed to
be a viable way of finding positive EV. While the math checks out at a basic level, it should be tested further to make
sure that it actually is finding Positive Expected Value Bets.
