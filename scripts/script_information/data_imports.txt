The first step of the bet scanning program is the importation of the various
events and their betting lines from the respective books. This is currently done
in two steps. The reason for this is that the standard markets and the alternate
markets must be accessed in two different ways. While this could be done in the
same file, I am splitting it up for simplicity.

The first file, data_import.py, imports the standard markets. It grabs the h2h, totals,
and spreads markets. Each event that is pulled has an event ID. This is then passed on as
a list to the alternate_import.py file where I call the alternate markets for each event
given its unique event ID.

TBD: The data may be parsed and placed into the same database with the lines being added to
the lines_data table. This would simplify things, but it will only work if the lines are all
compatible.
