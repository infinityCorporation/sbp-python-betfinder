To run the server manually navigate to /var/app and run:

>> venv/staging-LQM1lest/bin/python3 current/index.py

Otherwise, the server uses crontab to run every 15 minutes at current. To access crontab to make edits you
can type:

>> crontab -e

To save, it is a vim environment so you can use ":wq" to write and quit or ":q!" to quit without saving.
