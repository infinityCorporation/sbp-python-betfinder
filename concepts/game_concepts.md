## Game Concepts

The goal here is to outline some concepts for improving the data analytics capabilities of ProPicks. This file
will focus mainly on the data revolving around games and team specific odds for games.

#### Ideas:
Using historical odds, we could track how a teams odds change as we approach game time. The data could be analyzed to 
display three main data statistics. The first would be the average change within a given amount of time of
the game's start time. We could add historical data points to create an average that could be visualized for how 
a teams odds change as you approach game time. Finally, we could track the average spread for a teams odds between
different books. This could all be done using the historical odds endpoint from the Odds Api.
